## Custom Provider Example

This example uses google, but you can use any provider.
Create a Google Dev Console project and obtain a client ID and client secret.
Set The relevant URLs in the `main.go` file.

Set the `ClientID` and `ClientSecret` constants in the `main.go` file with your client ID and client secret.

To run the example, navigate to the `examples/custom_provider` directory and execute the `main.go` file using the `go run` command.

```bash
go get github.com/djsisson/jade
cd examples/custom_provider
go run main.go
```
